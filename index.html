          <figcaption><p>Stephanie strives to perform to the top of her potential in her career and has found that she excels at that while working remotely.  The new normal has allowed her to create the perfect space for her to succeed (and it is by her snakes too!).

          <img src="./images/Daddy Art.png" alt="Image of a painting done by Robin's and Stephanie's children given as a gift to Robin for Father's Day." class="two-one">
          <figcaption><p>Stephanieâ€™s passion for her hobbies is palpable at times, as evidenced by this amazing work of art given to me as a gift from my children.  Stepanie was able to guide them into exploring their own artistic sides in an effort of collaboration (which is not always easy between siblings) and my favorite part is that the stars are fingerprints.
